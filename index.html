    <p>HTML looks and functions well by default without the need for CSS or JavaScript. <br />This page includes the majority of HTML
         elements, including semantic HTML elements, that have a unique visual style or interaction. <br /> Web developers should 
         consider writing custom CSS instead of relying on bloated libraries where a significant portion of CSS code isn't used.
